  * Merge branch 'master' of github.com:ethz-asl/libpointmatcher
  * fix problem with libnabo linking (#54)
  * Adapted the code to handle 2D point clouds and decided to split the initial/icp/complete transformation matrices in 3 different files. It should be easier to post process the transformations.

  * Changed the ICP example (pmicp) to accept initial translation/rotation input and allow to output the transformation matrices
  * CutBelowLevelDataPointsFilter (PR #48)
  * split unit tests (PR #47)
  * Delete roadmap.txt
  * change year to 2014
  * correct bug in DataPoints operator==
  * add a method to remove features or descriptors
  * add empty function for removing features and descriptors
  * add functions to DataPoints avoiding error on rows and cols
  * fill missing documentation
  * resolve warning from unsigned to int in IO.cpp
  * add extra empty line in utest
  * add extra unit tests and resolve remaining bugs
  * Refactored how to load PLY files
  * Allow 2D descriptors (##45)
  * Allow saving 2D descriptors coming from a 2Dmap, that are converted to 3D when writing to the file but needed after if we want to load the map as 2D.
